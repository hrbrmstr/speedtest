Description: The 'Ookla' 'Speedtest' site <http://beta.speedtest.net/about> provides
    interactive and programmatic services to test and compare bandwidth speeds from 
    a source node on the Internet to thousands of test servers. Tools are provided
    to obtain test server lists, identify target servers for testing and performing
    speed/bandwidth tests.
